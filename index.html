            <h2 id="hhd">An Overview of Air-Pollution</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;font-size: large;">
                Air pollution is the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful substances, including gases, particulates, and biological molecules. It results primarily from human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agriculture. Major pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants have detrimental effects on human health, contributing to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature death. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. Additionally, air pollution harms the environment by degrading ecosystems, acidifying water bodies, and damaging vegetation. It also contributes to global challenges like climate change, as pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) enhance the greenhouse effect, warming the planet. Efforts to combat air pollution include transitioning to cleaner energy sources, improving fuel standards, enhancing public transportation, and implementing stricter environmental regulations. Despite progress, air pollution remains a significant global issue, especially in urban areas and developing countries.

        <h2 id="hhd">Environmental Impact of Air-Pollution</h2>
        <p class=lnk>Air pollution has significant and harmful effects on the environment, impacting the health of ecosystems, wildlife, and the climate. Pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) contribute to acid rain, which damages forests, soils, and water bodies, harming plants, fish, and other aquatic life. Ground-level ozone, another common pollutant, can inhibit plant growth and reduce crop yields, affecting agriculture and food supplies.

    Moreover, air pollution contributes to climate change by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to global warming, which disrupts weather patterns, melts polar ice, and raises sea levels. Airborne particulate matter, especially black carbon, also accelerates the melting of glaciers and snow in polar and mountainous regions.
    
    Overall, air pollution degrades biodiversity, threatens wildlife habitats, and compromises the balance of ecosystems, underscoring the urgent need for solutions to reduce emissions and protect the planet’s health.
